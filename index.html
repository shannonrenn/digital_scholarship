          <p class="p-about">The department was formed in the Spring Semester of 2016, and is just getting underway with new initiatives and activities. We work closely with colleagues throughout the library, and will continue expanding and refining our goals over the coming year. For a preview of our planned activities, check out our goals. The DS team includes seven full-time library staff members, student workers, and a connected network of collaborators in the library and around campus. Our primary activities are aimed to support new forms, media and methods through data curation and management, engaging with developing methods, digital humanities, and project-based work, and with new publishing models, especially open access publishing.</p>

          <p class="p-about">The Digital Scholarship Fellowship is a year-long collaborative program for undergraduates that integrates digital tools, theory, and methods. No prior experience is needed to apply--this fellowship is primarily a learning experience for enthusiastic and driven scholars. The eight students selected to become DS fellows will participate in biweekly workshops that run throughout the year, on topics such as web design; project and information management; data analysis; accessibility; and digital tools for text analysis. They will also work together to develop and build a digital scholarship project of their own. At the end of the academic year, each fellow will have the opportunity to participate in a paid summer internship related to digital scholarship in the Philadelphia area.<br></br>Read more about the program </p>
